# mint
I wrote mint for two reasons:
- Teach myself C
- Help me learn calculus, differential equations, linear algebra, and some more advanced physical chemistry concepts (both quantum mechanics and thermodynamics)

#  Planned features
- variable support
- specific math functions

I have some extra ideas for how to extend the interpreter.  I like the idea of making it LISP-y, but with array programming features.  Who knows if I'll ever get to that.
